This is a project From The Odin Project's [curriculum]
(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

It's a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

It starts with a 16x16 grid and then you can choose any size, with 64 row/column cells maximum.

You can swap between full-rgb or grayscale hover colors and it includes an erase mode.
